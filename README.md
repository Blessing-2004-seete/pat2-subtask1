Morse code is a method of encoding textual information using sequences of short and long signals—commonly referred to as dots (.) and dashes (-)—to represent letters, numbers, and punctuation. These signals can be transmitted via sound, light, or electrical pulses, making Morse code a versatile communication system across various media.
Historical Context
Morse code was developed in the 1830s by American inventor Samuel F.B. Morse and his collaborator Alfred Vail as part of the early electrical telegraph system. The need for rapid long-distance communication—especially in government, military, and railway operations—drove its invention. The first public demonstration occurred in 1837, and by 1844, Morse famously transmitted the message “What hath God wrought?” from Washington, D.C. to Baltimore.
Over time, Morse code became a global standard, especially after the International Morse Code was introduced in 1851 to accommodate non-English characters. It played a vital role in maritime communication, military operations (notably in World War II), and emergency signaling—famously used during the Titanic disaster to send the distress signal “SOS”.
 How the System Works
Morse code operates on a binary system of dots and dashes:
- A dot is a short signal (also called a “dit”).
- A dash is a longer signal, typically three times the duration of a dot (called a “dah”).
Each character in the alphabet is assigned a unique combination of these signals. For example:
- A = .-
- B = -...
- S = ...
- O = ---
The famous distress signal SOS is represented as ... --- ....
Timing and spacing are crucial:
- A space between dots and dashes within a character = 1 dot duration.
- A space between characters = 3 dot durations.
- A space between words = 7 dot durations.
